  <h1>Edward Snowden 2013</h1>

  <p>Former CIA employee and NSA contractor Edward Snowden copied hundreds of thousands of documents from his workplace covering dozens of confidential US national security programs.
    Snowden worked with journalists in the US and UK to bring the programs to light.
    Among the programs Snowden's revelations exposed was PRISM, where the NSA collected data with the assistance of companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Google.

  <h1>HTML 5 is Announced 2014</h1>

  <p>HTML 5 is announced as the successor to HTML 4, which had become the standard for web markup languages in 1997.
    Markup languages describe how web pages will look and function. Work on HTML 5 had begun in 2004 under the auspices of the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group.
    It was simplified compared to its predecessors and was intended to be human-readable.
    HLTML 5 also offered a number of improvements for multimedia, such as simplifying the embedding of content such as streaming video and games into web pages.
