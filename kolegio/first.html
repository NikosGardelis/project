            <h2>First camera phone introduced 2000</h2>
            <pre>
                Japan's SoftBank introduces the first camera phone,
                the J-Phone J-SH04; a Sharp-manufactured digital phone with integrated camera.
                The camera had a maximum resolution of 0.11 megapixels a 256-color display,
                and photos could be shared wirelessly. The J-Phone line would quickly expand,
                releasing a flip-phone version just a month later.
                Cameras would become a significant part of most phones within a year,
                and several countries have even passed laws regulating their use.

            <h2>USB Flash drive 2000</h2>
            <pre>
                USB Flash drives are introduced.Sometimes referred to as jump drives or memory sticks,
                these drives consisted of flash memory encased in a small form factor container with a USB interface.
                They could be used for data storage and in the backing up and transferring of files between various devices.
                They were faster and had greater data capacity than earlier storage media.
                Also, they could not be scratched like optical discs and were resilient to magnetic erasure, unlike floppy disks.
                Drives for floppy disks and optical discs faded in popularity for desktop PCs and laptops in favor of USB ports after flash drives were introduced.
