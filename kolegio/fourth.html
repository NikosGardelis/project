  <h1>Bitcoin 2008</h1>

  <p>In 2008, “Satoshi Nakamoto,” likely a pseudonym, publishes Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,
    describing the use of peer-to-peer networks to generate a “crypto-currency.” 
    In the Bitcoin system, users run software that searches for blocks of data, the discovery of which reward the users with Bitcoins.
    The transaction is recorded on the system though user information is private. These can then be used online much like cash in the real world.
    Nakamoto 'mines' the first Bitcoins in January 2009 and a year later a user used them to order two pizzas.
    Bitcoins’ value exploded in November 2013 before a gradual devaluation.
    Bitcoin's anonymous nature, along with the electronic nature of the currency, has led to its adoption by some criminal organizations.

  <h1>The Apple iPad is released 2010</h1>

  <p>The iPad combines many of the popular capabilities of the iPhone,
    such as built-in high-definition camera, access to the iTunes Store,
    and audio-video capabilities, but with a nine-inch screen and without the phone.
    Apps, games, and accessories helped spur the popularity of the iPad and led to its adoption in thousands of different applications from movie making,
    creating art, making music, inventory control and point-of-sale systems, to name but a few.
